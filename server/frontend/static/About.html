          <p class="card-text">Lucas "Luffy" D. Gear, CEO of *Best Cars Dealership*, 
            grew up in a family of mechanics but always dreamed bigger—he wanted to build a dealership 
            where *anyone* could find their perfect ride. At 17, he set out on an adventure, 
            learning the trade, outsmarting shady dealers, and assembling a loyal crew of expert mechanics and salespeople. 
            With his fearless energy, wild promotions (like free road trips with every car purchase), 
            and signature red vest and straw hat, Lucas turned *Best Cars Dealership* into more than 
            just a business—it became a place where people *chase their adventure*. His motto? *"Find your road, chase your adventure."* 🚗💨</p>
